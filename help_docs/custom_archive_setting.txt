AWSOM Archive Custom archive setting Help File


The Custom Archive Setting fields allow you to make major changes to the entries displayed by your Archive. 


Here are some examples of what would be directly entered in the input boxes for different basic scenarios.
Note: Leave setting boxes blank if nothing is shown for that setting. Numbers listed for limit to category numbers settings are examples, use actual category numbers specific to your site.
You can find the category numbers for your sites categories by going to the Posts-->Categories settings area and hovering over a category name and seeing the number listed in the tag_ID= field of the URL

example to only display entries from one category:

type: postbypost
format: option
limit to category numbers: 1

example to only display entries from more than one category:

type: postbypost
format: option
limit to category numbers: 1,2,3 

example to exclude display entries from one category:

type: postbypost
format: option
limit to category numbers: -1 

example to exclude display entries from more than one category:

type: postbypost
format: option
limit to category numbers: -1,-2,-3
