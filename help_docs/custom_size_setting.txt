AWSOM Archive Custom Size setting Help File

This setting is designed to compensate for when some servers misformat the drop down box width size to be too small
for the text that is being displayed. In cases like this you need to add in a number here that will dictate the width
of the drop down box. You may need to play with this a bit to get the size you want.
