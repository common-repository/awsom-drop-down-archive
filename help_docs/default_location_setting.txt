AWSOM Archive Default Location setting Help File

By Default AWSOM Archive displays it's output on your index page above your posts area. AWSOM Archive was designed to
minimize the need for the user to directly alter their theme files in order to get an archive area to
appear on their site. This setting turns on or off this behavior for advanced users who would prefer
to place the archive output in an alternate location. Turn this
setting to "No" to have the Archive block only appear in locations where you have placed
the theme code or post/page code. Leave this setting on "Yes" if you want the Archive
block to appear in ever location including the default one.

The code for placing the Archive in a custom location in a theme file is listed
in the Options-->Awsom Archive admin page. Simply paste this into your theme file where you
want the Archive to display. An alternate method of display is to use the AWSOM Archive
post/page code %%awsomarchive%% to have the Archive output appear in a post or page.

Please Note that you may have as many locations active as you'd like using any combination
of theme code, post/page code and Default location and the Archive will display
in every location (even multiple pages/posts and theme code locations).
